\subsection{Via whole heap file}\label{via-whole-heap-file}

Because the heap files are unclustered/unordered, we need:

\[
  \frac{\text{number of all records}}{\text{number of records per page}} = \frac{10^6}{10} = 10^5
\]

\subsection{B+ tree index (alternative2)}\label{b-tree-index-alternative-2}

Denote
$\alpha$ as occupancy ratio of B+ tree,
$\beta$ as ratio of between size of one data entry and size of one record,
$F$ as the fan-out of the tree,
and $Q$ as the number of qualifying pages.

Then, we need

\[
  \log_F \frac{\beta}{\alpha} 10^5 + Q
\]

\subsection{Hash index (alternative 2)}\label{hash-index-alternative-2}

Again we use the notations from above, we need to use

\[
  \frac{\beta}{\alpha} 10^5 + Q
\]
